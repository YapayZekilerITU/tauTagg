This repostitory contains works on different models for the purpose of identifying hadroncilly decaying tau leptons as signal
Data intro is the code that came with the data though it was edited heavily during our  work, it includes many visualizations
Coordinate change takes the original data intro p4 building functions and adds angular coordinates required for the models
Visualization has visualizations made by us
