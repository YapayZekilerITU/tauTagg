data resource: https://zenodo.org/records/13881061
This repostitory contains works on different models for the purpose of identifying hadroncilly decaying tau leptons as signal

First place to start is the data intro which is where the first preprocessings are done in order to do the coordinate changes requried by the models
Also in data intro there are some visulizations

Then work with the models can be found in their respecting folders, work on the ParticleFlow Network is done in efntest file
