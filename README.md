This repostitory contains works on different models for the purpose of identifying hadroncilly decaying tau leptons as signal

First place to start is the data intro which is where the first preprocessings are done in order to do the coordinate changes requried by the models. Also separate root files are created for the use in Particle Transformer with the specified columns names
Also in data intro there are some visulizations.

The .yaml file is for Particle Transformer to read our .root files, it preprocesses and formats data according to the needs of the model specified in their github page referanced in the term report

Then work with the models can be found in their respecting folders, work on the ParticleFlow Network is done in efntest file
